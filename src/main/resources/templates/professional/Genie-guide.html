            <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction to Grant Genie</h2>
            <p>Grant Genie is designed to assist researchers, startups, and organizations with writing grant proposals for European programs. Currently, we support:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ERC (European Research Council)</li>
                <li>Eurostars</li>
                <li>Horizon Europe</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our system ensures you stay in the driver’s seat by giving you full control over the content and flow of your grant submissions. While Grant Genie helps you draft, refine, and improve grant proposals, users are always in control, keeping the process human-driven. This aligns with the rigorous expectations of European funding bodies.</p>

            <p>Additionally, Grant Genie integrates with Grant Genius, an interactive chatbot designed to assist with any questions about the grant programs we support. Grant Genius can provide quick guidance on European Union grants and clarify specific funding criteria, ensuring you always have access to relevant advice during the proposal process.</p>

            <h2 id="getting-started">2. Getting Started</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Accessing Grant Genie</h3>
